# Full implementation of Convolutional Neural Network

### Inspiration
- This idea started as a personal project after reading Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
- The first OOP-based approach happened after watching CS231n on youtube, and that is the current implementation.

### Results
- The convolutional neural network implementation achieved 99.36% accuracy on the validation set of the MNIST dataset.
